# WebApplication2

This is a simple ASP.NET Core Web API project. The project demonstrates basic web application functionality, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) operations. It is structured to provide a starting point for more complex applications.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **Controllers**: Contains the API controllers that handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **Models**: Defines the data models used in the application.
- **Services**: Implements the business logic of the application.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Supports basic operations such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting records.
- **Dependency Injection**: Follows ASP.NET Core's built-in dependency injection pattern for managing service lifetimes.
- **Routing**: Utilizes attribute-based routing for API endpoints.

## API Endpoints

The following are the main API endpoints available in the application:

- `GET /api/[controller]`: Retrieves a list of all items.
- `GET /api/[controller]/{id}`: Retrieves a specific item by ID.
- `POST /api/[controller]`: Creates a new item.
- `PUT /api/[controller]/{id}`: Updates an existing item by ID.
- `DELETE /api/[controller]/{id}`: Deletes an existing item by ID.
